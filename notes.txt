vite = tool that run and build frontend projects faster

drizzle ORM = talk to db safely
TypeScript = safer JS
dotenv = environment variables
clerk = authentication (login)

tsconfig.json -> run typescript because js cannot recognize typesrcipt at first 

 "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon",   // run nodemon
    "build": "tsc"      // run typescript, convert ts to js and output files into dist/
  }

  clerk = library for sign up authentication using fb, google...

  env = settings and password for all files (must be included in gitignore so all files won't be published)

  drizzle schema = database structure written in code (TypeScript). Define tables and their attributes

  index.ts/db = set up connection to db
  index.ts = start express api server
