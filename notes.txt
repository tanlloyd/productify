vite = tool that run and build frontend projects faster

drizzle ORM = talk to db safely
TypeScript = safer JS
dotenv = environment variables
clerk = authentication (login)

tsconfig.json -> run typescript because js cannot recognize typesrcipt at first 

 "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon",   // run nodemon
    "build": "tsc"      // run typescript, convert ts to js and output files into dist/
  }

  clerk = library for sign up authentication using fb, google...

  env = settings and password for all files (must be included in gitignore so all files won't be published)

  drizzle schema = database structure written in code (TypeScript). Define tables and their attributes

  index.ts/db = set up connection to db
  index.ts = start express api server

  github workflow: (check 1hr 10 min on yt)
  1. create a branch for yourself for own copy of code
  2. work on the branch
  3. commit on the branch to save work
  4. push the branch to github (not main yet)
  5. create a pull request on github to merch branch to main
  6. merge pull request (only code in main)

  routes folder = routes that the app will use to decide what code runs
  controller folder = store all the function of the routes (get, post like express)

  clerk = login and user management service (give login for gmail/email, authentication...)
  daisyUI = react components library
